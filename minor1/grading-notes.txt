[Manoj Q1]

Latex errors - far too many. please use $_{TV}$ instead of $_TV$ 
Please use $\mu$ and $\nu$ instead of $mu$ and $nu$

Cool idea - to use induction.

Bad idea - to add inequalities correctly.
	The step where he goes from
	\pr(X \neq Y) \leq \pr(X_1 \neq Y_1) + \pr(X_2 \neq Y_2)
	to 
	dist(mu,nu) \leq dist(mu_1,nu_1) + dist(mu_2,nu_2) 

	is an incorrect use of inequalities.
	a<a' AND b<b' AND c<c' AND a'<=b'+c' DOES NOT IMPLY a<=b+c. (same for >)

Wrong proof - what do I give him? ... 70%? (he wrote a correct base case and IH. Incorrect proof?)

[Manoj Q2]

More latex errors!

Like the valid coupling proof - Px is a bijection :)
Wanted bound on \tmix(\epsilon) not just \tmix(1/4) ... sadness.
Going from \tmix(1/4) to \tmix(\epsilon) is really just a small change. 

I'd say 90% because calculation error, really. you can't just forget epsilon :(

[Manoj Q3]
\tmix(1/4) not \tmix(\epsilon)... not penalizing for this.
Argumentation is correct for the coupling used.
The coupling essentially matches Aldous.
(n^4) bound instead of (n^3 log(n))


[Manav Q1]
Could've argued that (X_i,Y_i) and (X_j,Y_j) are independent, but its okay.

[Manav Q2]
Argued expected waiting time. Unclear how he went from Pr(A) to Expected waiting time.
Didn't continue to show a bound on \tmix(\epsilon) ... what does expected waiting time have to do with \tmix(\epsilon)
